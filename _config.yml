  I'm an experienced "Data Analyst". After completing my graduation in Information technology, I have decided to pursue my career in this booming data-driven industry as a data specialist. To reach my professional destination, I completed my two graduate certificates in "Data analytics for business marketing decisions" and in "Artificial intelligence". I have worked with startups, building analytics dashboards to help investors, and clients invest in the right ventures, building and presenting reports to the stakeholders. During my internship in SIC Technologies, Iâ€™ve also contributed my work to the Gujarat government (state of India) as a data analyst.
