   End to End Data Visualization Web-app Using Streamlit — From Data Scraping to Deployment.
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    I have scrapped the Cricket stats data from ESPN-Cricinfo and deployed all the visualizations using streamlit. To build an interactive visualizations web app I have used streamlit's inbuild features and then deployed it through Heroku.

    Comparison Between Visualization Platforms Such as Excel, Tableau, PowerBi, and Matplotlib/Seaborn

    Comparing different data visualization platforms while analyzing the dataset. In this comparison project, I have used a dataset from "Washington Post" which has various types of data fields. From all the known platforms, I visualized the dataset on Excel, Tableau, PowerBi, and Matplotlib/Seaborn which are very popular. In the end, I concluded my decision about which platform has more edge.

    Predicting the quality of a cannabis plant, based on its botanical measurements.

   As the plant classification quality is required to be “best” in order to be properly processed for medical use, I used machine learning models to determine the quality of the plants. The model will be able to separate the quality into three parts. "Best" is for medical purposes, "Good & Average" is for recreational purposes, "Low" as in garbage.

    Building a classifier for the bank to check whether the applicant is approved for the loan or not.

    For every bank deciding whether to approve the loan for the candidate is a very important decision. In this project, I have used tree-based algorithms to build my model. The dataset contains various columns which have more than 2000 categories. To deal with this situation, I have used encoding techniques and a PCA algorithm.
